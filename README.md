### Description

The Snake Eyes Bonnet is a Raspberry Pi accessory for driving two 128x128 pixel OLED or TFT LCD displays, and also provides four analog inputs for sensors. It's perfect for making cosplay masks, props, spooky sculptures for halloween, animatronics, robots...anything where you want to add a pair of animated eyes!

This product is just the Pi Bonnet itself, and some headers so you can plug it into a Pi. While it will work with any Raspberry Pi with a 2x20 Header (Pi B+, Pi 2, Pi 3, Pi Zero, etc) you'll get best performance from a Pi 3 since we do some heavy duty OpenGL rendering!

**This product doesn't include two displays or connector cables!**
